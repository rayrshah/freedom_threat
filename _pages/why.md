We built the Index to serve a three-fold purpose

-	To benchmark progress or backsliding by our political culture, a bulwark against “Normalization.”

-	To provide context for journalists and citizens looking for perspective on the implications of current events.  (This can serve as either a spur to action, or a calming of panic, depending upon the user’s predisposition.)

-	To educate concerned citizens on the full range of safeguards and vital elements of freedom and democracy.

Our 2016 wake-up-call demanded that we benchmark the authoritarian actions of government and counter the creeping “normalization” of outrageous leadership.

The Threat to Freedom Index keeps tabs on the status of authoritarianism versus freedom and democracy.  At its core is a set of scoresheets that grade over 60 relevant conditions; from Media Access to Prison Conditions, Judicial Independence to Voting Rights.  Each Friday (and more often, when necessary) we tally a fresh score and share it via our website [USFreedomIndex.org] and Twitter account [@USFreedomIndex].

This week the Index happens to be at 572, on a scale of 1 to 1,000, where 1,000 is Utopian Healthy Democracy and anything below 50 is Autocracy.  (572 corresponds to the “Danger” zone, the Orange zone between “Caution,” and “Alarm.”)

History shows that every prelude to autocratic takeover has its own special character, but we’re calling in a broad spectrum of advisors to help us keep track of the most salient indicators.  At The Index’s core is a score sheet, with sixty elements of democracy, (polling, judicial independence, police behavior, transparency, media freedom, etc.) in 9 categories (Administration, Judiciary, Police and Military, Media, Economy, Democracy, Social Structures, Personal Liberties, and Conflict)  Monitors rate each element on a range from HEALTHY DEMOCRACY, CAUTION, DANGER, ALARM and FAIL.

We are currently in search of an umbrella non-profit and seed money to fund:  More monitors, a Communications team and a DIY version for smaller demographic sectors.
