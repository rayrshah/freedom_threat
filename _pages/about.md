This is the Beta version of the Freedom Index.  We are currently in search of seed money to make this a valuable and enduring tool for benchmarking democracy.  Funding at this crucial point will help us build our monitoring teams, create a communications team, and fund technical support and data transmission.  If you are interested in supporting this project, please reach out to us at:
