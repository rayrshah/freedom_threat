The Threat to Freedom Index gauges the health of Democracy in the US.  We monitor over sixty vital signs across nine categories to estimate how near or far we are from authoritarianism and publish the score here weekly.


ABOUT

This is the Beta version of the Freedom Index.  We are currently in search of seed money to make this a valuable and enduring tool for benchmarking democracy.  Funding at this crucial point will help us build our monitoring teams, create a communications team, and fund technical support and data transmission.
